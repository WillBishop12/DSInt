# DSInt

Code from the Springboard Data Science Intensive, which I completed in 2016-17. This online course included:

- Exercises in inferential statistics and data exploration
- Working with JSON and XML data in Python
- Mini-projects in linear and logistic regression, Naive Bayes, PCA, and k-means clustering
- A capstone project in which I built linear and logistic regression models of flight delay based on timing, location, and airline
